# islegaltriangle(s1, s2, s3)
# Write the function islegaltriangle(s1, s2, s3) that takes three int or float values representing
# the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and returns True if such a triangle exists and False
# otherwise. Note from the triangle inequality that the sum of each two sides must be greater
# than the third side, and further note that all sides of a legal triangle must be positive. Hint:
# how can you determine the longest side, and how might that help?

def islegaltriangle(s1, s2, s3):
	# your code goes here
	a = max(s1,s2)
	b = max(a,s3)

	if( s1 > 0 and s2 > 0 and s3 > 0):
		if ( s2+s3 > s1 and b ==s1):
			return True
		elif( s1+ s3 > s1 and b ==s2):
			return True
		elif( s2+s1 > s3 and b == s3):
			return True
		else:
			return False
	else:
